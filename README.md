"Guess a Number" is a simple console game written in **JavaScript**.

The user has to guess the number that his opponent (the computer) has come up with.
The program randomly selects a number between **1** and **100**. It will then ask the player to **enter their guess**.
Each time you enter a number the computer will tell you whether it is **lower** or **higher** than the expected number.

The user has a limited amount of attempts to guess the correct number, if exceeded he is prompted with a message.
If the user enters an invalid input which is not a number between **1** and **100** he is also prompted with a message.

You win the game when your number matches the computer generated number.
