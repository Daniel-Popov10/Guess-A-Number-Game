"Guess a Number" is a simple console game written in JavaScript where the user has to guess a number that the program randomly generates. The number is always between 1 and 100. Each time you enter a number you will be told whether to go higher or lower. The player has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number after which the game is over.
